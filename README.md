# NewtonVisualization
Graphic visualization of Newton's second law using C#<br/>

It is build with C# / .NET using windows forms.<br/>

This project is a visualization of Newton's second law. <br/>
Frictions are not taken care of, so the mass parameter can be ignored when you set the parameters.<br/>

Launch the program, click on restart and indicate the parameters on the form that will open. <br/>
Then click on Launch button.<br/>

The project is in progress and new features like friction will be added soon.<br/>
